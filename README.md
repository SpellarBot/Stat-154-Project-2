# Stat-154-Project-2
Cloud Data
# EDA
We started our project with exploratory data analysis. We firstly use some basic pandas methods to calculate the % of pixels for the different classes. Then we used Seaborn package to plot the expert label according to x, y coordinates. We also use “corr = image2.corr()” and “sns.heatmap” to plot the correlation of each variable. After that, we use “sns.boxplot” to plot the distribution of each variables hued by different expert labels.
