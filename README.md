# EDA:
We started our project with exploratory data analysis. We firstly use some basic pandas methods to calculate the % of pixels for the different classes. Then we used Seaborn package to plot the expert label according to x, y coordinates. We also use “corr = image2.corr()” and “sns.heatmap” to plot the correlation of each variable. After that, we use “sns.boxplot” to plot the distribution of each variables hued by different expert labels.
# Preprocess Data: 
To preprocess the data, we first drop all the unlabeled data since it doens't matter much for our prediction. You can not run this part if you want to keep the unlabeled data for future usage. 
Then
